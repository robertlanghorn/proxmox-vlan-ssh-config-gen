# üß∞ Proxmox VLAN SSH Config Generator

This script automatically generates a `~/.ssh/config` file to streamline SSH access to Proxmox VMs or containers. It's tailored for homelab environments that use a VLAN-based IP scheme derived from container IDs.

---

## üîß Overview

This script is built specifically for Robert Langhorn's Proxmox homelab setup. Each container ID corresponds directly to the VLAN and IP address the container is assigned to. For example:

* Container ID `856` is on **VLAN 80**
* It receives the IP address: `10.0.80.56`

  * `80` comes from the first digits (VLAN √ó 10)
  * `56` is derived from the last two digits of the ID

The script:

* Scans `~/.ssh/` for private keys named like `container-856-key`
* Extracts container IDs from the filenames
* Generates corresponding SSH config entries
* Inserts a standard `Ciphers` line at the top
* Sorts entries numerically by container ID
* Backs up the previous config to `config.bak`

Example entry generated:

```ssh
Host vm856
  HostName 10.0.80.56
  User ubuntu
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/container-856-key
```

## üì• Installation

```bash
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:robertlanghorn/proxmox-vlan-ssh-config-gen.git
cd proxmox-vlan-ssh-config-gen
chmod +x proxmox-vlan-ssh-config-gen.sh
```

---

## üöÄ Usage

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This script **overwrites** your existing `~/.ssh/config` file. Any existing configuration, including custom `Ciphers` lines, will be replaced.

To regenerate your SSH config:

```bash
./proxmox-vlan-ssh-config-gen.sh
```

This will:

* Backup your current config as `~/.ssh/config.bak`
* Generate a new, alphabetically sorted SSH config from available keys

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements

* Private SSH keys are named `container-<id>-key`
* Keys are created after cloning a **cloud-init-enabled Proxmox VM template**
* Remote VMs/containers allow login with `User ubuntu`
* VLANs and IPs follow the ID-to-VLAN mapping scheme described above

---

## üß† Notes

* Ideal for homelabs with structured IP/VLAN assignment
* Run the script after provisioning or rekeying VMs
